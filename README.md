# Project: Odin-kittens (API)

This project is a website that is both a normal HTML-producing back end AND an API that can be used to pull data from it.
You could use Javascript calls from the front end to dynamically refresh your data now or even to load the whole page in the first place. Or maybe you’ll be hooking up a Kittens app to your iPhone and need a back end. It doesn’t matter, since now you’ve got a RESTful API.

## A RESTful API
The aim of this project is to have an understanding of the RESTful API and how it works and can be achieved with this application.

You can find this project full description following [Odinproject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/apis) curriculum.
